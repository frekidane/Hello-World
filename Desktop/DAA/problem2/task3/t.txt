1, Binary search
 
--> For the binarySearch.js
/* 
Space Complexity: The space complexity of your implementation is 𝑂(log𝑛) due to the recursive calls.
                 Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack until the base case is reached.
*/



2, Hash table search

--> For the linearSearch.js
/* 
Space Complexity: The space complexity of linearSearch is 𝑂(1), because it doesn't use any extra space proportional 
                to the input size n aside from a few variables (i, isFound), which are constant in size.
